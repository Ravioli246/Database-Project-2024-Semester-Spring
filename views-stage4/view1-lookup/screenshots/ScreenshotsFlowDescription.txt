then...

in "flow of update" we can see where we got errors for 'update' and then 'delete', so:

1-InsertQueryError is where we're trying to insert a new book, so after this and before 2-SelectInsertedBook,
    post the trigger that fixes this error. use insert trigger

2-SelectInsertedBook shows update working

3-Update1Query updates the book to a new title and details ("updated")

4-Updated shows the successful update

5-deleteError:
  1-error: shows error trying to delete (dataType)
  2-fix  : fixes error with int -> bigint
  3-proof: screenshot of working delete statement after fix
